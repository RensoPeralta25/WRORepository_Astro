#ðŸš€ First Prototype Design
--------------------------------
## Initial Sketch and Concept

Our first prototype was designed with a minimalist yet strategic approach to sensor integration and mechanical structure. The initial concept called for five ultrasonic sensors strategically distributed around the chassis to provide full 360-degree obstacle detection coverage: a front-facing center sensor for primary detection, two front-facing sensors angled at 45Â° (left and right) to cover side blind spots, and two side sensors at 90Â° for wall following and narrow-space detection. Additionally, a color sensor was integrated into a protruding rectangular structure on the front of the robot, specifically designed to position the sensor at an optimal height with a downward tilt angle to allow for accurate detection of the black circuit line, while minimizing ambient light interference thanks to its wraparound design. For advanced navigation and obstacle recognition, a camera was mounted on the top center of the chassis, enabling visual processing to identify and classify obstacles using computer vision algorithms. Finally, an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) was positioned on top of the robot, directly above the center of gravity, to provide precise orientation data (yaw, pitch, and roll angles) and stabilization during navigation, crucial for maintaining straight trajectories and executing turns with angular precision. The mechanical structure was complemented by front arms specifically designed for mounting the front wheels, providing an independent steering system that improves maneuverability and allows for precise turning radius adjustments. The rectangular configuration of the front color sensor mount not only fulfills its sensory function but also acts as a structural element that reinforces the front of the chassis and provides protection against minor impacts.
