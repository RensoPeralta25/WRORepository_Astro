## Introduction
This project presents our autonomous vehicle designed for the 2025 World Robot Olympiad (WRO) competition in the Future Engineers category. The robot is fully autonomous, capable of navigating a closed course, detecting and avoiding objects, and parking itself at the end of the course.

### What Makes Our Design Unique

Our vehicle stands out for its redundant and robust sensor architecture: it integrates four strategically positioned ultrasonic sensors that provide full 360¬∞ perimeter detection, a color sensor for precise object identification, and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) that allows the robot to maintain orientation and stability in real time.

The brain of the system is a state-of-the-art Raspberry Pi 5 working in conjunction with an Arduino Mega via the Robot Hat v4, creating a dual architecture that separates high-level processing (vision and decision-making) from real-time control (motors and sensors). This hybrid configuration guarantees ultra-fast responses and system stability.

Visually, the robot features a futuristic, technological design in white, reflecting innovation and modernity. The precision servo steering system ensures smooth and accurate maneuvers, while data fusion from multiple sensors enables reliable autonomous navigation even in challenging track conditions.

### üöÄ First Prototype Design

Our first prototype was designed with a minimalist yet strategic approach to sensor integration and mechanical structure. The initial concept called for five ultrasonic sensors strategically distributed around the chassis to provide full 360-degree obstacle detection coverage: a front-facing center sensor for primary detection, two front-facing sensors angled at 45¬∞ (left and right) to cover side blind spots, and two side sensors at 90¬∞ for wall following and narrow-space detection.

### üöÄ Second Prototype Design

After having thought about this sketch, for reasons of optimizing the position of sensors, we decided to completely change the design of our autonomous robot. As mentioned before, we wanted to have 6 ultrasonics, to help us have more vision.
