### üöÄ First Prototype Design

<img width="600" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b4e8dc8-8090-4ecc-8f10-5860a87f4374" />

Our initial chassis design was conceived with a compact, enclosed structure that prioritized sensor integration and component protection. The first prototype incorporated the following design elements:

*Sensor Layout*:
The chassis featured mounting positions for four ultrasonic sensors strategically distributed to provide comprehensive obstacle detection coverage around the vehicle's perimeter.

*Camera Integration*:
A dedicated frontal mounting space was designed to house the Raspberry Pi Camera module, positioned to provide an optimal field of view for computer vision and object detection tasks.

*Internal Electronics Compartment*:
The original design included an enclosed internal cavity intended to house all electronic components, including the Raspberry Pi 5, Robot Hat v4, Arduino, sensors, and wiring. This approach aimed to protect the electronics from external interference and provide a clean, organized appearance.

*Motor Placement*:
A designated space was allocated for the DC motor; however, the initial design lacked detailed consideration for motor mounting mechanics, power transmission, and drivetrain integration.

*Critical Design Oversight*:
During the physical assembly phase, we encountered a significant spatial constraint that was not apparent in the CAD model. The combined height of the Raspberry Pi 5 board and the Robot Hat v4 interface board exceeded the available vertical clearance within the internal compartment. We had not physically measured these stacked components during the design phase, assuming the CAD dimensions would accommodate them.

*Consequence*: The electronics could not fit inside the chassis as originally planned.

*Immediate Solution*: We repositioned the Raspberry Pi 5 and Robot Hat v4 assembly on top of the chassis structure, securing them with standoffs and mounting brackets. While this modification solved the spatial issue and improved heat dissipation and accessibility, it exposed the electronics to potential impacts and increased the vehicle's center of gravity.

Motor Integration Challenge:
Similarly, the motor mounting system was insufficiently detailed in the first prototype. The lack of proper motor brackets, shaft alignment considerations, and drivetrain coupling mechanisms became evident during assembly.

Resolution: This oversight necessitated a complete chassis redesign to properly integrate the motor system, optimize weight distribution, and ensure reliable power transmission to the wheels.

This experience highlighted the critical importance of:

*Physical measurement and test-fitting of components before finalizing CAD designs
Accounting for tolerance stack-up and assembly clearances
Detailed planning of mechanical subsystems (motor mounts, drivetrain, wiring routes)
Iterative prototyping to validate design assumptions*

These challenges directly informed the development of our second prototype, which addressed all identified spatial and mechanical integration issues.

üöÄ Second Prototype Design

After evaluating the limitations of our first prototype, we decided to completely redesign the chassis to optimize sensor positioning and improve overall functionality. Building on lessons learned, we planned to incorporate five ultrasonic sensors for enhanced environmental awareness.

Ultrasonic Sensor Holder Design

<img width="608" height="246" alt="chasis largo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1977c2ee-f1ab-4214-951c-4f69846def59" />

We designed a dedicated ultrasonic sensor holder to accommodate the five sensors we intended to use: two positioned at the front for forward obstacle detection, one at the rear for reverse awareness, and two mounted mid-chassis for lateral coverage. While this configuration seemed optimal in theory, practical testing revealed a critical flaw‚Äîthe two front-mounted sensors created physical interference with the front wheel assembly during steering maneuvers, necessitating their removal from the chassis.

Front Wheel Support Structure

<img width="200" height="200" alt="soporte rueda" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fea2f472-2f9c-48e3-ba95-0378646b812f" />

Unlike the first design, the second prototype featured an improved front wheel support system. This component served a dual purpose: securely mounting the wheel assembly while providing a stable connection point to the vehicle's outer cover. The redesigned support improved structural rigidity and simplified the assembly process.

<img width="200" height="200" alt="segundo soporte ruedas" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb8ba79f-5925-48d6-8951-4cd918968b57" />

üîß Challenges and Solutions During Final Design

During the development and assembly of our autonomous vehicle, we encountered several technical challenges that required creative solutions and design modifications. These challenges taught us valuable lessons about iterative design and practical engineering problem-solving.

<img width="600" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5808995-2f03-4338-a36a-282f4b9e5cf4" />

Dimensional Compliance: Reducing Vehicle Length

Critical Constraint: Competition regulations required vehicles to not exceed specific dimensional limits. Our second prototype measured 11.8 inches in length, exceeding the maximum allowed dimension by one full inch.

Problem: The chassis design, while functionally sound, was too long to comply with competition rules. The extended length was primarily due to:

The frontal sensor mounting structure extending beyond necessary limits
The battery holder positioned too far forward
Overall chassis design that prioritized component spacing over compactness

Solution - Comprehensive Chassis Modification:
We implemented a series of strategic modifications to reduce the vehicle's footprint:

Front Section Reduction: We cut and removed approximately one inch from the front portion of the chassis, eliminating excess material while maintaining structural integrity for the camera mount and essential frontal components.

Color Sensor Relocation: Instead of mounting the TCS 3200 color sensor externally on the front surface, we created a custom opening on the underside (bottom) of the chassis. This modification allowed us to recess the sensor into the chassis body, positioning it closer to the ground for optimal line detection while recovering valuable frontal space.

Battery Holder Repositioning: We recessed the battery mounting bracket deeper into the chassis cavity, moving it further back from the front edge. This change not only reduced overall length but also improved weight distribution by centering the battery mass.

<img width="600" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34787083-5dad-4437-b0b3-238b8af1a8ce" />

Ultrasonic Sensor Reduction: To accommodate the shortened chassis and address other constraints (detailed below), we removed three ultrasonic sensors from the design, further simplifying the frontal structure.

Result: These combined modifications successfully reduced the vehicle length from 11.8 inches to 10.8 inches, achieving full compliance with competition regulations while maintaining all essential functionality.
Arduino Pin Limitations and Sensor Reduction
Problem: Our initial plan to use five ultrasonic sensors, combined with the color sensor, IMU, camera interface, servo motor, and DC motor driver, exceeded the available GPIO pins on the Arduino UNO R3. Each ultrasonic sensor requires two digital pins (trigger and echo), meaning five sensors would consume 10 pins alone, leaving insufficient pins for other critical components.
Solution: We strategically reduced the ultrasonic sensor count from five to two, retaining only the most essential sensors for navigation:

One front-facing sensor for primary obstacle detection
One side-mounted sensor for wall-following and lateral awareness

This reduction freed up six digital pins (3 sensors √ó 2 pins each), allowing all remaining components to be properly connected without requiring a larger microcontroller.
Ultrasonic Sensor Interface Selection: Raspberry Pi vs. Arduino
Problem: During initial testing, we attempted to interface the ultrasonic sensors directly with the Raspberry Pi 5 GPIO pins. However, we encountered persistent issues with unreliable distance readings and inconsistent sensor response times. The problem stemmed from the Raspberry Pi's non-real-time operating system (Linux), which cannot guarantee precise microsecond-level timing required for accurate ultrasonic echo pulse measurement.
Solution: We decided to connect the ultrasonic sensors to the Arduino UNO R3 instead of the Raspberry Pi. The Arduino's real-time microcontroller architecture provides deterministic timing, ensuring accurate pulse duration measurements. The Arduino reads the sensor data and transmits processed distance values to the Raspberry Pi via serial communication (UART) through the Robot Hat v4 interface.
Technical Justification:

Arduino UNO R3: Real-time operation with precise microsecond timing for reliable ultrasonic measurements
Raspberry Pi 5: Handles higher-level processing (computer vision, navigation logic, decision-making) without timing-critical sensor interfacing

This division of responsibilities between the two processors optimized system reliability and performance.
Color Sensor Integration
One of the first challenges we faced was fitting the color sensor into its designated mounting space. The original CAD design did not account for the actual physical dimensions and connector orientation of the TCS 3200 color sensor module.
Problem: The color sensor module, including its I2C connector pins, exceeded the allocated space in the front sensor mount structure. The rigid PCB design prevented us from repositioning it without structural modifications.
Solution: We used a soldering iron to carefully create a custom opening in the bottom of the plastic chassis. This allowed us to recess the sensor body while keeping the optical window at the optimal height and angle for line detection. The modification maintained the sensor's downward-facing orientation (approximately 30-45¬∞ angle) necessary for accurate color detection of the track surface while minimizing ambient light interference.
Result: The color sensor was successfully integrated and provided reliable line detection throughout testing while contributing to the overall length reduction of the chassis.
Rear Wheel Support Structure Failure
Problem: The 3D-printed rear wheel support arms, designed to hold rubber tires in place, experienced structural failure during initial testing. The stress concentration points where the tires connected to the motor shafts caused the plastic supports to crack and eventually break. This was likely due to:

Insufficient wall thickness in the 3D-printed part
Vibrations from the DC motors during operation
Lateral forces during turning maneuvers

Solution: Unable to quickly redesign and reprint the support structure, we implemented an emergency repair using a soldering iron technique:

We carefully heated the soldering iron to a temperature suitable for melting PLA/ABS plastic
We repositioned the broken rubber tire holders against the motor mounting arms
We used the soldering iron tip to "weld" the plastic pieces together, creating a reinforced joint
We added additional plastic material where needed to strengthen critical stress points

Result: This field repair successfully restored structural integrity and proved durable enough for the remainder of our testing and competition preparation. However, this experience highlighted the importance of stress testing 3D-printed components and designing with appropriate safety margins for dynamic loads.
Microcontroller Selection Optimization
Our electronic architecture underwent a significant simplification during the final assembly phase.
Original Plan: Arduino Mega 2560

Reason for selection: The Mega provides 54 digital I/O pins and 16 analog inputs, which we initially believed necessary to accommodate multiple ultrasonic sensors, the color sensor (I2C), the IMU (I2C), servo motors (PWM pins), and the DC motor driver.

Modified Implementation: Arduino UNO R3

Reason for change: After reducing the ultrasonic sensor count to two, the total pin requirement decreased significantly:

2 ultrasonic sensors: 4 digital pins (2 trigger + 2 echo)
Color sensor: I2C bus (SDA/SCL) - 2 pins
IMU: I2C bus (shared) - 0 additional pins
Servo motor (steering): 1 PWM pin
DC motor driver: 2-4 digital pins
Total: approximately 9-11 pins

The Arduino UNO R3 provides 14 digital I/O pins and 6 analog inputs, which is more than sufficient for our reduced configuration. This change offered several advantages:

Reduced physical footprint: The Uno is smaller and lighter than the Mega
Improved space utilization: Easier to fit within the compact chassis
Cost optimization: Lower component cost without sacrificing functionality
Simplified wiring: Fewer unused pins reduced wiring complexity
Real-time sensor reliability: Better ultrasonic sensor performance compared to Raspberry Pi GPIO

Power Distribution Solution
Managing multiple 5V power connections for sensors and modules with limited power pins on the Arduino.
Solution: We implemented a breadboard-based power distribution system:

Positive rail (5V): Connected to Arduino's 5V output pin
Ground rail (0V/GND): Connected to Arduino's GND pin
Connected devices: All sensors requiring 5V power (ultrasonic sensors, color sensor) were connected to the breadboard rails

Advantages:

Organized and accessible power distribution
Easy troubleshooting and component replacement
Reduced stress on Arduino's voltage regulator by distributing current load
Clean cable management

#include <Servo.h> // To control the servo
#include <SR04.h> // For ultrasonic sensors
```

**Installation:** In the Arduino IDE, go to `Tools > Manage Libraries` and search for these libraries.

## üíª Step-by-Step Code Explanation

### 1. Pin Definitions

```cpp
// ULTRASONIC PINS
#define TRIG_PIN_L 7 // Left sensor trigger pin
#define ECHO_PIN_L 6 // Left sensor echo pin
#define TRIG_PIN_R 5 // Right sensor trigger pin
#define ECHO_PIN_R 4 // Right sensor echo pin

// COLOR SENSOR PINS
#define s0 8 // Frequency setting
#define s1 9 // Frequency setting
#define s2 10 // Color filter selection
#define s3 11 // Color filter selection
#define out 12 // Frequency output

// SERVO PIN
#define SERVO_PIN 3 // Servo control pin
```

### 2. Variables globals

```cpp
int data = 0; // Stores the color frequency
int degs; // Degrees for the servo
long distance_usl; // Left sensor distance
long distance_usr; // Right sensor distance
```

### 3. Object Creation

```cpp
SR04 ul = SR04(ECHO_PIN_L, TRIG_PIN_L); // Left ultrasonic sensor
SR04 ur = SR04(ECHO_PIN_R, TRIG_PIN_R); // Right ultrasonic sensor
Servo servo; // Servo object
```

### 4. Initial Setup

```cpp
void setup() {
Serial.begin(9600); // Start serial communication

// Configure color sensor pins
pinMode(s0, OUTPUT);
pinMode(s1, OUTPUT);
pinMode(s2,OUTPUT);
pinMode(s3,OUTPUT);
pinMode(out,INPUT);

// Sets frequency to 100% (maximum precision)
digitalWrite(s0,HIGH);
digitalWrite(s1,HIGH);

// Starts servo in center position (70¬∞)
servo.attach(SERVO_PIN);
servo.write(70);

delay(2000); // Waits 2 seconds to stabilize
}
```

### 5. Main Loop

The code performs the following operations continuously:

#### a) Servo control via serial
```cpp
if (stringComplete) {
inputString.trim(); // Clears spaces
degs = inputString.toInt(); // Converts text to numbers
servo.write(degs); // Move the servo
inputString = "";
stringComplete = false;
}
```

**Servo limits:**
- Right: 30¬∞
- Left: 130¬∞
- Center: ~70-80¬∞

#### b) Reading ultrasonic sensors
```cpp
distance_usl = ul.Distance(); // Left distance in cm
distance_usr = ur.Distance(); // Right distance in cm
```

#### c) Reading the color sensor

The sensor detects the RGB components of the reflected light:

```cpp
// Detect RED
digitalWrite(s2, LOW);
digitalWrite(s3, LOW);
int r = pulseIn(out, LOW);

// Detect GREEN
digitalWrite(s2, LOW);
digitalWrite(s3, HIGH);
int g = pulseIn(out, LOW);

// Detect BLUE
digitalWrite(s2, HIGH);
digitalWrite(s3, HIGH);
int b = pulseIn(out, LOW);
```

**How ‚Äã‚Äãdoes it work?**
- S2/S3 combinations select which color to detect
- `pulseIn` measures the pulse time (shorter time = greater color intensity)

#### d) Sending data
```cpp
Serial.println(String(distance_usl) + "|" + String(distance_usr) + "|" +
String(r) + "|" + String(g) + "|" + String(b));
```

Output format: `distance_left|distance_right|red|green|blue`

### 6. Receiving serial commands

```cpp
void serialEvent() {
while (Serial.available()) {
char inChar = (char)Serial.read();
if (inChar == '\n') {
stringComplete = true; // Mark the command complete
} else {
inputString += inChar; // Construct the command
}
}
}
```

This function is executed automatically when data arrives via serial.

This is the full path to the Python script that will run when the button is pressed.
Important: Update this path to match your script location

5. Initial LED State
pythonled.on()
Turns on the LED when the program starts, indicating the system is ready.
6. Main Control Loop
pythonwhile True:
    if button.value() == 1:  # Pressed
        led.on()
        os.system(f"python3 {script_path}")  # Execute the other script
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Avoid repetition due to bounce
    else:
        led.off()
    time.sleep(0.1)
Loop Behavior:

Button Check: button.value() returns:

1 when button is pressed (connected to ground)
0 when button is not pressed (pulled high)

When Button is Pressed:

LED turns ON
External script executes using os.system()
0.5 second delay prevents multiple triggers (debouncing)

When Button is Released:

LED turns OFF
