### 🚀 First Prototype Design

<img width="611" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b4e8dc8-8090-4ecc-8f10-5860a87f4374" />

Our initial chassis design was conceived with a compact, enclosed structure that prioritized sensor integration and component protection. The first prototype incorporated the following design elements:

*Sensor Layout*:
The chassis featured mounting positions for four ultrasonic sensors strategically distributed to provide comprehensive obstacle detection coverage around the vehicle's perimeter.

*Camera Integration*:
A dedicated frontal mounting space was designed to house the Raspberry Pi Camera module, positioned to provide an optimal field of view for computer vision and object detection tasks.

*Internal Electronics Compartment*:
The original design included an enclosed internal cavity intended to house all electronic components, including the Raspberry Pi 5, Robot Hat v4, Arduino, sensors, and wiring. This approach aimed to protect the electronics from external interference and provide a clean, organized appearance.

*Motor Placement*:
A designated space was allocated for the DC motor; however, the initial design lacked detailed consideration for motor mounting mechanics, power transmission, and drivetrain integration.

*Critical Design Oversight*:
During the physical assembly phase, we encountered a significant spatial constraint that was not apparent in the CAD model. The combined height of the Raspberry Pi 5 board and the Robot Hat v4 interface board exceeded the available vertical clearance within the internal compartment. We had not physically measured these stacked components during the design phase, assuming the CAD dimensions would accommodate them.

*Consequence*: The electronics could not fit inside the chassis as originally planned.

*Immediate Solution*: We repositioned the Raspberry Pi 5 and Robot Hat v4 assembly on top of the chassis structure, securing them with standoffs and mounting brackets. While this modification solved the spatial issue and improved heat dissipation and accessibility, it exposed the electronics to potential impacts and increased the vehicle's center of gravity.

Motor Integration Challenge:
Similarly, the motor mounting system was insufficiently detailed in the first prototype. The lack of proper motor brackets, shaft alignment considerations, and drivetrain coupling mechanisms became evident during assembly.

Resolution: This oversight necessitated a complete chassis redesign to properly integrate the motor system, optimize weight distribution, and ensure reliable power transmission to the wheels.

This experience highlighted the critical importance of:

*Physical measurement and test-fitting of components before finalizing CAD designs
Accounting for tolerance stack-up and assembly clearances
Detailed planning of mechanical subsystems (motor mounts, drivetrain, wiring routes)
Iterative prototyping to validate design assumptions*

These challenges directly informed the development of our second prototype, which addressed all identified spatial and mechanical integration issues.

### 🚀 Second Prototype Design

After having thought about this sketch, for reasons of optimizing the position of sensors, we decided to completely change the design of our autonomous robot. As mentioned before, we wanted to have 5 ultrasonics, to help us have more vision.

<img width="608" height="246" alt="chasis largo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1977c2ee-f1ab-4214-951c-4f69846def59" />

We designed an ultrasonic holder, in order to create an espace for the 5 sensors that we planned to use. Two in the front part of the robot, one in the back and two more in the middle. We thought this was a good idea, but it was not. The two sensors in the front part interfered with the front wheels, so we had to move it from the chassis.

Another thing that we design diferently compare to the first design is the support for the front wheels. This part helped us to secure the wheel with the cover of the vehicle.

## 🔧 Challenges and Solutions During Final Design

During the development and assembly of our autonomous vehicle, we encountered several technical challenges that required creative solutions and design modifications. These challenges taught us valuable lessons about iterative design and practical engineering problem-solving.

One of the first challenges we faced was fitting the color sensor into its designated mounting space. The original CAD design did not account for the actual physical dimensions and connector orientation of the TCS 3200 color sensor module.

**Problem:** The color sensor module, including its I2C connector pins, exceeded the allocated space in the front sensor mount structure. The rigid PCB design prevented us from repositioning it without structural modifications.

**Solution:** We used a soldering iron to carefully create a custom opening in the plastic chassis mount. This allowed us to recess the sensor body while keeping the optical window at the optimal height and angle for line detection. The modification maintained the sensor's downward-facing orientation (approximately 30-45° angle) necessary for accurate color detection of the track surface while minimizing ambient light interference.

**Result:** The color sensor was successfully integrated and provided reliable line detection throughout testing.

#### Ultrasonic Sensor Reduction

Our initial design included six HCSR04 ultrasonic sensors for comprehensive 360° obstacle detection coverage. However, physical constraints and spatial optimization led to significant changes.

**Problem:** The front-mounted color sensor required substantial space in the frontal area of the chassis. Installing the two front-angled ultrasonic sensors (positioned at 45° left and right) would have created physical interference with both the color sensor mount and its cable routing. Additionally, the overall chassis space was more limited than anticipated in the CAD model.

**Solution:** We strategically removed four of the six ultrasonic sensors:
- **Two front sensors (45° angled):** Removed due to space conflict with the color sensor assembly
- **Two additional sensors:** Removed to optimize weight distribution and simplify wiring complexity

We retained only the two most critical ultrasonic sensors:
- **Front-center sensor:** For primary forward obstacle detection
- **One side sensor:** For wall-following and lateral distance measurement

**Trade-off Analysis:** While this reduced our sensor coverage from 360° to bilateral coverage, our testing revealed that the remaining sensors, combined with the camera's computer vision capabilities and IMU data, still provided sufficient environmental awareness for successful navigation.

#### Rear Wheel Support Structure Failure

**Problem:** The 3D-printed rear wheel support arms, designed to hold rubber tires in place, experienced structural failure during initial testing. The stress concentration points where the tires connected to the motor shafts caused the plastic supports to crack and eventually break. This was likely due to:

- Insufficient wall thickness in the 3D-printed part
- Vibrations from the DC motors during operation
- Lateral forces during turning maneuvers

**Solution:** Unable to quickly redesign and reprint the support structure, we implemented an emergency repair using a soldering iron technique:
1. We carefully heated the soldering iron to a temperature suitable for melting PLA/ABS plastic
2. We repositioned the broken rubber tire holders against the motor mounting arms
3. We used the soldering iron tip to "weld" the plastic pieces together, creating a reinforced joint
4. We added additional plastic material where needed to strengthen critical stress points

**Result:** This field repair successfully restored structural integrity and proved durable enough for the remainder of our testing and competition preparation. However, this experience highlighted the importance of stress testing 3D-printed components and designing with appropriate safety margins for dynamic loads.

Our electronic architecture underwent a significant simplification during the final assembly phase.

**Original Plan:** Arduino Mega 2560
- **Reason for selection:** The Mega provides 54 digital I/O pins and 16 analog inputs, which we initially believed necessary to accommodate six ultrasonic sensors (12 digital pins), the color sensor (I2C), the IMU (I2C), servo motors (2 PWM pins), and the DC motor driver (4 digital pins).

**Modified Implementation:** Arduino Uno R3
- **Reason for change:** After reducing the ultrasonic sensor count from six to two, the total pin requirement decreased significantly:
  - 2 ultrasonic sensors: 4 digital pins (2 trigger + 2 echo)
  - Color sensor: I2C bus (SDA/SCL) - 2 pins
  - IMU (BNO055): I2C bus (shared) - 0 additional pins
  - Servo motor (steering): 1 PWM pin
  - DC motor driver: 2-4 digital pins
  - **Total: approximately 9-11 pins**

The Arduino Uno R3 provides 14 digital I/O pins and 6 analog inputs, which is more than sufficient for our reduced configuration. This change offered several advantages:
- **Reduced physical footprint:** The Uno is smaller and lighter than the Mega
- **Improved space utilization:** Easier to fit within the chassis alongside other components
- **Cost optimization:** Lower component cost without sacrificing functionality
- **Simplified wiring:** Fewer unused pins reduced wiring complexity

### Power Distribution Solution

Managing multiple 5V power connections for sensors and modules with limited power pins on the Arduino.

**Solution:** We implemented a breadboard-based power distribution system:
- **Positive rail (5V):** Connected to Arduino's 5V output pin
- **Ground rail (0V/GND):** Connected to Arduino's GND pin
- **Connected devices:** All sensors requiring 5V power (ultrasonic sensors, color sensor) were connected to the breadboard rails

**Advantages:**
- Organized and accessible power distribution
- Easy troubleshooting and component replacement
- Reduced stress on Arduino's voltage regulator by distributing current load
- Clean cable management

**Considerations:** We ensured that the total current draw from all 5V devices did not exceed the Arduino's maximum output current (approximately 500mA from USB or 800-1000mA from VIN regulator).
